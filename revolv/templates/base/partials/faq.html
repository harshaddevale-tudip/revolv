Through crowdfunding, RE-volv lets individuals who support clean energy chip in a few dollars to help communities all over the United States go solar. These donations help finance solar systems for community-based nonprofits that lack access to traditional solar financing. These organizations save money on their electric costs while paying RE-volv back through a 20-year lease with interest. The lease payments are reinvested in a revolving fund, the Solar Seed Fund, which continually finances new community-based solar projects. Over time, each dollar donated to an individual solar project will go towards financing a new project, which will help finance the next project, and so on.</li>

The RE-volv lease then immediately saves the nonprofit 15% or more on their current electricity rates. Over the course of the lease, while utility rates are escalating every year, the nonprofit’s savings will accelerate. When the lease ends, RE-volv transfers ownership to the nonprofit at no cost.

Solar modules are typically warrantied for 25 years, and rarely need to be replaced. Inverters, on the other hand, are typically warrantied for 10-15 years. However, our operations & maintenance package covers any issues with the equipment, so RE-volv will replace an inverter when needed.

Specifically, we reimburse the annual difference between expected and actual output at the end of each year – a money-back guarantee per kilowatt-hour. To date, none of our systems have under-produced.<li>

Or, the nonprofit can use our early buyout option to pay-off the lease at a discounted rate, then include the solar system in the property valuation.

Your donation will help fight climate change and reduce the nonprofit’s electricity costs by 15% or more. As the nonprofit makes lease payments to our revolving fund, the Solar Seed Fund, your donation is repaid to your RE-volv portfolio.

This is where things get interesting! These payments go to our revolving fund, the Solar Seed Fund, and are redistributed to each campaign donor with a small return on the original donation. Every month you can go into your portfolio and see how much you have collected through your donation repayments. You then control which new nonprofit’s solar crowdfunding campaign to reinvest your donation repayments in. Your donation continues to fund solar projects across the country.<li>
